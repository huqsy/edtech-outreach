    <h2>Affordability</h2>
    <p><strong>What is this pain point?</strong> Many EdTech tools come with high subscription fees or licensing costs, making them inaccessible to low income students or schools operating on tight budgets.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> For EdTech to have widespread adoption, it must be affordable to schools of all sizes and budgets, especially in underfunded areas. Affordability ensures equal access to quality educational resources.</p>

  <!-- Equity & Inclusivity Page -->
  <div id="equity-page" class="page" style="display:none;">

    <p><strong>What is this pain point?</strong> EdTech tools need to address the barriers that prevent students from feeling included or excelling, whether due to language, disabilities, or lack of access to technology.</p>

    <h3>Sample Email</h3>

    <h2>Student Engagement</h2>
    <p><strong>What is this pain point?</strong> Many traditional EdTech tools fail to keep students engaged, especially in virtual or hybrid environments where distraction is easy.</p>

  <div id="learning_curve-page" class="page" style="display:none;">
    <h2>Low Learning Curve for Teachers</h2>
    <p><strong>What is this pain point?</strong> Teachers are often overwhelmed by new technology that requires extensive training, which can discourage adoption.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="active_learning-page" class="page" style="display:none;">
    <h2>Active Learning Support</h2>

    <h3>Sample Email</h3>

    </ul>
    <button onclick="goBack()">Back</button>
  </div>

  <div id="learning_aids-page" class="page" style="display:none;">
    <h2>Built-In Learning Aids (AI, Hints, etc.)</h2>

  </div>

  <div id="ease_of_use-page" class="page" style="display:none;">
    <h2>Ease of Use for Students & Teachers</h2>
    <p><strong>What is this pain point?</strong> Both teachers and students need tools that are intuitive and easy to navigate. Complicated interfaces discourage adoption and frustrate users.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If a tool is difficult to use, neither students nor teachers will engage with it fully. Simplicity and ease of use are key to successful integration into daily workflows.</p>

  <div id="compatibility-page" class="page" style="display:none;">
    <h2>Cross-Platform Compatibility</h2>

<div id="integration-page" class="page" style="display:none;">
    <h2>Integration with Existing Tools</h2>
    <p><strong>What is this pain point?</strong> Schools and teachers often use multiple platforms like Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams, or other learning management systems (LMS). EdTech tools need to integrate seamlessly with these existing systems to reduce friction.</p>
